Greedy Motif Search Solution
'''

'''
This greedy algorithm is designed to determine the most probable kmer in each string of a collection
of DNA strands by first building an initial profile matrix of nucleotide frequencies for the first kmer
in the first DNA strand, which is then used to determine the most probable kmer in each additional strand.
As a new kmer is selected, the profile matrix is updated to reflect the addition of the kmers nucleotides.
This final collection of kmers from all strands is then compared to the first set of first kmers in all
strands to determine of a lower score has been achieved. If so, the new set of kmers in kept and the 
process repeats for all possible kmers in the first strand.
